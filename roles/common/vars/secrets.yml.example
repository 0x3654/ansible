# Example secrets file for common role
# Copy this file to secrets.yml and modify as needed

# After role execution, these variables will be available:
# docker_user_uid: UID of the docker_user (automatically set)
# docker_user_gid: GID of the docker_user (automatically set)

# SSH port (optional, defaults to 22)
# ssh_port: 2222

# HTTP port (optional, defaults to 80)
# http_port: 8080

# HTTPS port (optional, defaults to 443)
# https_port: 8443

# Example of using UID and GID in other tasks:
# - name: Set specific file permissions
#   ansible.builtin.file:
#     path: /path/to/file
#     owner: "{{ docker_user }}"
#     group: "{{ docker_user }}"
#     mode: "0644"
#   become: true
#   become_user: "{{ docker_user }}"
